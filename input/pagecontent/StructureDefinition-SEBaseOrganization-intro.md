### Use of organization.type
There are multiple code systems describing organization types in Sweden. <br />
- The National Board of Health and Welfare are maintaining a code system called "Verksamhetsomr√•den" that are used for reporting quality data to national quality registries: [Verksamhetskoder](https://www.socialstyrelsen.se/globalassets/sharepoint-dokument/dokument-webb/klassifikationer-och-koder/sjukhuskoder-kodlista-verksamhetsomraden-2006.pdf) <br />
- The Health and Social Care Inspectorate (IVO) also have a code system describing health care organizations that are used when reporting irregularities or register complaints. <br />
- The only code system we have found with a clear namespace that can be idendified and that are used widely in a interoperablilty context is the [HSA Verksamhetskoder](https://inera.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/OIKH/pages/346560593/HSA+kodverk). Therefore that is the only code system we chose to describe in the organization profile. Others can be used however.
